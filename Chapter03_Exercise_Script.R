# For both methods, the Ljung-Box test shows the residuals aren't white noise, and there are major 
# large spikes and their distribution of residual are not normal either
# If I have to choose, the snaive method is better with a smaller Q value than what naive 
# method has, and there is some seasonality in the data


#7. Are the following statements true or false? Explain your answer.
#a. Good forecast methods should have normally distributed residuals.
#b. A model with small residuals will give good forecasts.
#c. The best measure of forecast accuracy is MAPE.
#d. If your model doesn't forecast well, you should make it more complicated.
#e. Always choose the model with the best forecast accuracy as measured on the test set.
# Answer:
#a. It's useful to have normally distributed residuals, but it isn't necessary for good forecast methods to have them
#b. Good forecast methods don't need to have small residuals. But their residuals should be uncorrelated and have zero mean
#c. The best measure of forecast accuracy is different on a case by case basis.
#d. More complicated forecast method does not guarantee better forecast.
#e. When choosing a forecast model, whether the residuals have zero mean and whether they are uncorrelated should also be considered. Simply choosing best accuracy model isn't good.

#8. For your retail time series (from Exercise 3 in Section 2.10):
# a. Split the data into two parts using
myts.train <- window(myts, end=c(2010,12))
myts.test <- window(myts, start=2011)

# b. Check that your data have been split appropriately by producing the following plot.
autoplot(myts) +
  autolayer(myts.train, series="Training") +
  autolayer(myts.test, series = "Test")

# c.Calculate forecasts using snaive applied to myts.train.
snaive.myts.train <- snaive(myts.train)

# d.Compare the accuracy of your forecasts against the actual values stored in myts.test.
accuracy(snaive.myts.train,myts.test)

# e. Check the residuals.
checkresiduals(snaive.myts.train)
# Do the residuals appear to be uncorrelated and normally distributed?
# Answer, no. From ACF, there are large amounts of spike and the residuals are not normally distributed either.

# f.How sensitive are the accuracy measures to the training/test split?
# I think the author trying to ask the error ratio of training set compared to test set. If that is the case, it looked like 
# ME, RMSE, MAE, MASE are sensitive while MAPE & ACF1 aren't much sensitive

# 9.visnights contains quarterly visitor nights (in millions) from 1998 to 2016 for twenty regions of Australia.
