# 2.Download the file tute1.csv from the book website, open it in Excel (or some other spreadsheet application), 
#   and review its contents. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a 
#   quarterly series, labelled Sales, AdBudget and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company 
#   over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.

# a. You can read the data into R with the following script:
tute1 <- read.csv("tute1.csv",header=TRUE)
View(tute1)

# b. Convert data to time series:
mytimeseries <- ts(tute1[,-1],start=1981,frequency = 4)
# (The [,-1] removes the first column which contains the quarters as we don't need them now.)

# c. Construct time series plots of each of the three series
autoplot(mytimeseries,facets=TRUE)
# Check what happens when you don't include facets=TRUE.
autoplot(mytimeseries)

# 3. Download some monthly Australian retail data from the book website. 
#    These represent retail sales in various categories for different Australian
#    states, and are stored in a MS-Excel file.
# a. You can read the data into R with the following script:
#    skip=1 bc this excel has 2 header rows
retaildata <- readxl::read_excel("retail.xlsx", skip=1)
View(retaildata)

# b. convert into time series:
myts <- ts(retaildata[,"A3349335T"],
           frequency=12, start=c(1982,4))

# C. Explore data:
autoplot(myts,facets = TRUE)
ggseasonplot(myts, facets = TRUE)
ggsubseriesplot(myts, facets = TRUE)
gglagplot(myts)
ggAcf(myts)

# 4. ----------- Create tie plots for following series:
# - Use help() to find out about the data in each series.
help(bicoal)
help(chicken)
help(dole)
help(usdeaths)
help(lynx)
help(goog)
help(writing)
help(fancy)
help(a10)
help(h02)

# - For the goog plot, modify the axis labels and title:
autoplot(goog) +
  ggtitle("Daily closing stock prices of Google Inc.") +
  xlab("Time") + 
  ylab("Price(Unit:US$)")

# 5. Use the ggseasonplot and ggsubseriesplot functions to explore the seasonal patterns in the following time series: writing, fancy, a10, h02.
# - What can you say about the seasonal patterns?
# - Can you identify any unusual years?

ggseasonplot(writing)
ggsubseriesplot(writing)
# Sales amount plunge in August every year

ggseasonplot(fancy)
ggsubseriesplot(fancy)
# In Dec., since 1992 the month sales for souvier shop in Australia spikes compared to previous years

ggseasonplot(a10)
ggsubseriesplot(a10)
# In Feb, the amount of antidiabetes monthly scripts drops annually

ggseasonplot(h02)
ggsubseriesplot(h02)
# Similar to antidiabetes, the amount of corticosteroid scripts also drops but more dramatically inFeb. annualy

# -6. Use the following graphics functions: autoplot(), ggseasonplot(), ggsubseriesplot(), gglagplot(), ggAcf() and explore features from the following time series: hsales, usdeaths, bricksq, sunspotarea, gasoline.

# - Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend?
# - What do you learn about the series?

help(hsales)
autoplot(hsales)
ggseasonplot(hsales)
ggsubseriesplot(hsales)
gglagplot(hsales)
ggAcf(hsales, lag.max = 400)
# can catch seasonality and cyclicity. The cysle period is about 5 years

help("usdeaths")
autoplot(usdeaths)
ggseasonplot(usdeaths)
ggsubseriesplot(usdeaths)
gglagplot(usdeaths)
ggAcf(usdeaths, lag.max = 60)
# there is seasonality and cyclicity. The cycle period is per year, July got the highest death rate while Feb got the lowest

help("bricksq")
autoplot(bricksq)
ggseasonplot(bricksq)
ggsubseriesplot(bricksq)
gglagplot(bricksq)
ggAcf(bricksq, lag.max = 200)
# Can spot mild seasonality and strong trend

help("sunspotarea")
autoplot(sunspotarea)
#ggseasonplot(sunspotarea)
# not seasonal, can't draw it
#ggsubseriesplot(sunspotarea)
# not seasonal, useless to draw it
gglagplot(sunspotarea)
ggAcf(sunspotarea, lag.max = 50)
# Can spot strong cyclicity.The cycle period is about 5 years.

help("gasoline")
autoplot(gasoline)
ggseasonplot(gasoline)
#ggsubseriesplot(gasoline)
# The number of weeks is 52 and it looked like it is too much for subseriesplot
gglagplot(gasoline)
ggAcf(gasoline, lag.max = 1000)
# There is an overall uward trend but not strong one, but no seasonality or cyclicity .

# 7.The arrivals data set comprises quarterly international arrivals (in thousands) to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, UK and the US.

# - Use autoplot, ggseasonplot and ggsubseriesplot to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries.
# - Can you identify any unusual observations?
str(arrivals)
autoplot(arrivals)
# NZ has the biggest increasing arrives since 1980
# UK shows the biggest quarterly fluctuation

ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"Japan"])
ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"NZ"])
ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"UK"])
ggseasonplot(arrivals[,"US"])

ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"Japan"])
ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"NZ"])
ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"UK"])
ggsubseriesplot(arrivals[,"US"])
# The arrivals from Jp decrease a log in 2nd quarter compared to other quarters
# The arrivals from NZ are highest in 3rd quarter and lowest in 1st quarter
# The arrivals from UK and US are low in 2nd & 3rd quarter and high in 1st and 4th quarters

# 9. The pigs data shows the monthly total number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia, from Jan 1980 to Aug 1995.
# - Use mypigs <- window(pigs, start=1990) to select the data starting from 1990. Use autoplot and ggAcf for mypigs series
# - and compare these to white noise plots from Figures 2.17 and 2.18.
# - Figure 2.17
#[Fig 2.17 White Noise Time Series](https://otexts.com/fpp2/wn.html)

#-  Figure 2.18
# [Fig 2.18 ACF of White Noise Time Series](https://otexts.com/fpp2/wn.html)
help("pigs")
mypigs <- window(pigs, start=1990)
str(mypigs)

autoplot(mypigs)
ggAcf(mypigs)
# can spot 3 periods that are outside these bounds which is >3%, thus mypigs isn't white noise probably.

# 10. dj contains 292 consecutive trading days of the Dow Jones Index. Use ddj <- diff(dj) to compute the daily changes in the index. 
# -Plot ddj and its ACF. Do the changes in the Dow Jones Index look like white noise?

help(dj)

ddj <- diff(dj)
str(ddj)
autoplot(ddj)
ggAcf(ddj)
# Only one period is outside the bounds which much <3%, thus ddj can be white noise
